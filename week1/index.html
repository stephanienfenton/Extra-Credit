<h2> About Me </h2>
<p title="About Me"> Hello everybody! My name is Stephanie Fenton. Thank you for visiting my web page. </p>
<img src="stephanie.jpg" width="280" height="500" alt="Picture of myself" /> 
<h2> Background Information </h2> 
<p title="Background Information"> I am in my first year/first semester of the Learning Design and Technology M.S. program. 
    <br> I plan to concentrate in game based learning and analytics and E-Learning Design and Development. 
    <br> I am from Canada originally where the education system is arguably very different than in America.
    <br> My current professional background is in vocational rehabilitation counseling. Their wesbite is <a href="https://www.rehabworks.org">www.RehabWorks.org</a> if you would like to learn more about an important, often overlooked, Division within the Florida Department of Education, take a peek!.
    <br> I have taught 8th graders, adult learners, and the mentally incompetent in mental health felony court. 
    <br> I love teaching! 
    <br> I am not sure I could teach children full time, but I could certainly serve as an instructional designer for a K-12 school. 
    <br> I hope to continue my studies and eventually conduct research to prepare for a career in a business, government agency, or higher education institute. </p> 
<h2> Other Important Considerations</h2>   
<p title="Other Important Considerations">I believe in Social Justice and equal education for all. 
    <br> I hope by becoming an instructional technologist, I will be able to effect positive changes in our learning culture. 
    <br> Creativity, Innovation, and Technology are key to 21st century skill devleopment and performance enhancement in the classroom and work place. 
    <br> <b><em> Training methods that challange and entertain at the same time should be available to all students/adult learners.</b></em> </p>
<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p title="Career Goals">I enjoy working with adult learners. I enjoy working with children, but not as a K-12 teacher. 
    <br> I look forward to my M.S. program of study! Go Bulls!   
    <br> I have been here in Fort Lauderdale/Miami for many years either as a full time student or full time employee. I hope to maintain a career as a Learning Designer, Instructional technologist, Educational Consultant, or Game-Based Web Programmer in South Florida.  
    <br> My B.S. is in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Miami. For more info on their research, check out their website at <a href="https://micro.med.miami.edu/">micro.med.miami.edu.</a>
    <br> My dream job is to incorporate my learning experiences from medical school (the good, the bad, and the ugly) with game-based learning interventions. 
    <br>I am passionate about making a difference in the lives of <em>"Learners."</em></p>

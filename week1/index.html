<h2>Personal History</h2>
<p title="Persona History">
    <br> I am from Canada originally.
    <br> My current professional background is in vocational rehabilitation counseling. Their wesbite is <a href="https://www.rehabworks.org">www.RehabWorks.org</a> if you would like to learn more about an important, often overlooked, Division within the Florida Department of Education, take a peek!
    <br> I love teaching! I have taught 8th graders, adult learners, and the mentally incompetent in mental health felony court.  
    <br> I hope to continue my studies and eventually conduct research to prepare for a career in a business, government agency, K-12 institution, or higher education institute. </p> 
<h2> Other Important Considerations</h2>   
<p title="Other Important Considerations">I believe in Social Justice and equal education for all. 
    <br> I hope by becoming an instructional technologist, I will be able to effect positive changes in our learning culture. 
    <br> Creativity, Innovation, and Technology are key to 21st century skill devleopment and performance enhancement in the classroom and work place. 
    <br> <b><em> Training methods that challange and entertain at the same time should be available to all students/adult learners.</b></em> </p>
<h2>Career Goals</h2>

    <br> I have been here in Fort Lauderdale/Miami for many years either as a full time student or full time employee. 
    <br> I hope to maintain a career as a Learning Designer, Instructional technologist, Educational Consultant, or Game-Based Web Programmer in South Florida.  
    <br> My B.S. is in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Miami. For more info on their research, check out their website at <a href="https://micro.med.miami.edu/">micro.med.miami.edu.</a>
    <br> My dream job is to incorporate my learning experiences from medical school (the good, the bad, and the ugly) with game-based learning interventions. 
    <br> I am passionate about making a difference in the lives of <em>"Learners."</em></p>

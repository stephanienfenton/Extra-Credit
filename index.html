<h1> Steph's Instructionl Technology Site</h1>
<h2> About Me </h2>
<p title="About Me"> Hello everybody! My name is Stephanie Fenton. Thank you for visiting my web page. </P>
<img src="IMG10.jpg" width="280" height="500" alt="Picture of myself" /> 
<h2> Background Information </h2> 
<p title="Background Information"> I am in my first year/first semester of the Learning Design and Technology M.S. program. I plan to concentrate in game based learning and analytics and E-Learning Design and Development. My professional background is in vocational rehabilitation counseling currently. Their wesbite is <a href="https://www.rehabworks.org">www.RehabWorks.org</a> if you would like to learn more about an important, often overlooked Division within the Florida Department of Education. I have taught 8th graders, adult learners, and the mentally incompetent in mental health felony court. I love teaching! I am not sure I could teach children full time, but I could certainly serve as an instructional designer for a K-12 school. I hope to continue my studies and eventually conduct research to prepare for a career in a business, government agency, or higher education institute. 
<h2> Other Important Considerations</h2>   
<p title="Other Important Considerations">I believe in Social Justice and equal education for all. I hope by becoming an instructional technologist, I will be able to effect positive changes in our learning culture. Creativity, Innovation, and Technology are key to 21st century skill devleopment and performance enhancement in the classroom and work places. Training methods that challange and entertain at the same time should be available to all students/adult learners.</p>
<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p title="Career Goals">I enjoy working with adult learners. I enjoy working with children, but not as a K-12 teacher. I look forward to my M.S. program of study! Go Bulls! I am from Canada originally where the education system is arguably very different than in America. I have been here in Fort Lauderdale/Miami for many years either as a full time student or full time employee. My B.S. is in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Miami! (hence the color scheme!). For more info on their educational program, check out their website at <a href="https://micro.med.miami.edu/">micro.med.miami.edu.</a> I hope to find a position as a Learning Designer or Consultant and continue living in Florida. My dream job is to incorporate my learning experiences from medical school (the good, the bad, and the ugly) with game-based learning interventions. I am passionate about making a difference in the lives of "Learners."</p>
